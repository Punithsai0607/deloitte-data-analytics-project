# Deloitte - Customer Data Analytics Project

## Description
This project analyzes a sample customer transaction dataset to identify key business insights. The analysis mirrors the tasks of the Deloitte Data Analytics Virtual Internship, focusing on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to inform business strategy.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into three main stages, each contained in a separate Jupyter Notebook:
-   `notebooks/1_data_cleaning.ipynb`: Loads the raw data, handles missing values, and standardizes formats.
-   `notebooks/2_data_analysis.ipynb`: Performs EDA to uncover trends and identify high-value customer segments.
-   `notebooks/3_data_visualization.ipynb`: Creates visual charts to present the findings in an accessible format.

## Technologies Used
-   **Python**
-   **Pandas** for data manipulation and analysis.
-   **NumPy** for numerical operations.
-   **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** for data visualization.
-   **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive development.
-   **Visual Studio Code** as the IDE.
